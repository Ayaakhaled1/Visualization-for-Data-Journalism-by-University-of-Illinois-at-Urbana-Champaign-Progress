# Visualization-for-Data-Journalism-by-University-of-Illinois-at-Urbana-Champaign-Progress
Course Description While telling stories with data has been part of the news practice since its earliest days, it is in the midst of a renaissance. Graphics desks, which used to be deemed as “the art department,” a subfield outside the work of newsrooms, are becoming a core part of newsrooms’ operation. Those people (they often have various titles: data journalists, news artists, graphic reporters, developers, etc.) who design news graphics are expected to be full-fledged journalists and work closely with reporters and editors.    The purpose of this class is to learn how to think about the visual presentation of data, how and why it works, and how to do it the right way. We will learn how to make graphs like The New York Times, Vox, Pew, and FiveThirtyEight. In the end, you can share–embed your beautiful, interactive charts in publications, blog posts, and websites.
